# Setup your tools

We will be using Python tool (IPython, scikit-learn and matplotlib) for development and `git` for version control.

**It is highly recommemended that you switch to a ubuntu/mac system**
* Download and install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads)
* [Github windows client](https://desktop.github.com/). ubutnu users should have git installed by default, if not use your system's package manager (`apt-get`, `homebrew` for mac users)

### Learn and Practice git

* Complete the exercise https://github.com/AGV-IIT-KGP/git-sandbox, instructions and resources are given in the readme.

### Learn Python

* [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html), HTML and PDF versions are available for free on its website. Reading the first 30 pages should be enough to get you going.

### Learn Machine Learning (theory)

* [Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/)
* [Learning from Data: Caltech](http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html)
* [Machine Learning: Coursera: Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

### Learn Machine Learning (practice)

* [SciKit-Learn Tutorial](https://github.com/amueller/scipy_2015_sklearn_tutorial)

### Exploratory Data Analysis

* [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)

### Baysian Statistics

* [Think Bayes](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/thinkbayes.pdf)
* [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)

### Other Resources

* [Awesome Machine Learning](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning) List of Machine learning libraries and frameworks.
* [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets]
* [Data Science IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks)

Everybody need not learn everything rather is it recommended that each one of you learn one (different) thing and learn it well.
